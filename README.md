# SMS-spam-detection
The rapid expansion of mobile communication has led to an increase in the SMS messages exchanged between individuals and organizations. Unfortunately, this growth has also given rise to an alarming surge in SMS spam, which poses a significant threat to user's privacy and information security. To address this issue, we had proposed a machine learningbased approach for SMS spam classification. The goal of the system is to accurately classify SMS messages as spam or not-spam. The development process involves dataset selection, model training, application development, and integration with a web-based user interface. Once the model is trained and deemed effective, we are creating an application-based website using Stream lit, a Python library. A webpage is created, which features a text box where users can input an SMS message. The system then employs the trained model to classify the message as spam or not spam in real-time. The classification results are displayed on the webpage, providing immediate feedback to users. The SMS spam classification system developed in this project demonstrates the successful application of machine learning techniques to tackle the growing issue of SMS spam. The system showcases a comprehensive approach to building an effective and user-friendly system for spam classification in SMS communication.

PROPOSED SYSTEM

We are developing an user friendly platform in which we are providing user interface real time web application. The users can use this application and check whether the SMS is spam or not.

The development process involves:

Dataset Selection
Model training
Application Development
Integration with a web-based user interface
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and accurate machine learning model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and spam SMS messages in real-time.

REQUIREMENTS

Programming Languages: Python: Python is one of the most popular programming languages for machine learning and data analysis. It offers numerous libraries for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code (VS Code): These are popular IDEs for Python that facilitate code development, debugging, and data exploration.
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-Learn: Scikit-Learn is a versatile Python library for machine learning that provides tools for building and evaluating machine learning models. TensorFlow or PyTorch: These deep learning frameworks are useful for building more advanced models, such as neural networks and deep learning models. XGBoost or LightGBM: These libraries are used for gradient boosting, which can enhance the performance of your models.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): NLTK is a Python library for working with human language data. It includes various tools for tokenization, stemming, and other NLP tasks. spaCy: spaCy is another popular NLP library that offers efficient and fast text processing capabilities. Gensim: Gensim is often used for topic modeling and word embedding tasks.
Data Preprocessing Tools: Pandas: Pandas is a data manipulation library that is essential for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. NumPy: NumPy is used for numerical operations and array manipulation, which are common in data preprocessing.
Data Visualization Tools: Matplotlib and Seaborn: These libraries are used for creating data visualizations and plots to gain insights from the data.
Text Processing Tools: Regular Expressions (Regex): Regex is a powerful tool for pattern matching in text, which can be useful for identifying specific features in SMS messages. Text Blob: Text Blob simplifies text processing tasks, including sentiment analysis and part-of-speech tagging.
Database Management (Optional): SQLite or MySQL: To store and manage large volumes of SMS data, we may require a database management system.
Web Frameworks: To build a user interface for SMS spam detection system, web frameworks like Stream lit or Flask can be helpful.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, SMS spam classification using machine learning is an effective solution for identifying and blocking unwanted and potentially harmful text messages. It enhances user experience, improves security, and adapts to evolving spam tactics. Customization options empower users, while privacy and compliance are vital considerations. Finally, we conclude that this SMS Spam classification using machine learning improves messaging by filtering out spam, safeguarding user privacy, and enhancing the overall messaging experience. Detects, spam messages from unknown or known senders. Helps the people not be involved into any type of fraud activities or be safe from the hackers.
